Most of the sam sorting was done in command line, no need for sbatch.
Loaded samtools/1.13 with all necessary modules (module spider)

Thus from bowtie2, we get a .sam output. We convert this to bam with 
samtools view -b input.sam -o output.bam

Next is to sort the file. If this is not done indexing will not work
samtools sort input.bam -o output.bam

Lastly to index.
samtools index -b input.bam
